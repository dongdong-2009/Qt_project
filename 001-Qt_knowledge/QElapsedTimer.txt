qint64 QElapsedTimer::nsecsElapsed() const
Returns the number of nanoseconds since this QElapsedTimer was last started. Calling this function in a QElapsedTimer that was invalidated will result in undefined results.

On platforms that do not provide nanosecond resolution, the value returned will be the best estimate available.

This function was introduced in Qt 4.8.

See also start(), restart(), hasExpired(), and invalidate().
