M11	Error	Id expected	
M14	Error	Invalid id	无效的id
M15	Error	Duplicate id	id
M16	Error	Invalid property name name	无效属性名
M17	Error	Name does not have members	
M18	Error	Field is not a member of object	
M19	Warning	Assignment in condition	It could be a typing error.If it is intentional, wrap the assignment in parentheses.
M20	Warning	Unterminated non - empty case block	Case blocks should either be empty or end in a flow control statement such as break, return or continue.Alternatively you can indicate intentional fall through by ending with a // fall through comment.
M23	Warning	Do not use eval	
M28	Warning	Unreachable	Indicates that the underlined statement will never be executed.
M29	Warning	Do not use with	
M30	Warning	Do not use comma expressions	
M31	Warning	Unnecessary message suppression	
M103	Warning	Name is already a formal parameter	
M104	Warning	Name is already a function	
M105	Warning	Var name is used before its declaration	
M106	Warning	Name is already a var	
M107	Warning	Name is declared more than once	Variables declared in a function are always visible everywhere in the function, even when declared in nested blocks or for statement conditions.Redeclaring a variable has no effect.
M108	Warning	Function name is used before its declaration	
M109	Warning	Do not use Boolean as a constructor	
M110	Warning	Do not use String as a constructor	
M111	Warning	Do not use Object as a constructor	
M112	Warning	Do not use Array as a constructor	
M113	Warning	Do not use Function as a constructor	
M114	Hint	The function keyword and the opening parenthesis should be separated by a single space	
M115	Warning	Do not use stand - alone blocks	Blocks do not affect variable scoping.Thus blocks that are not associated to if, while, etc.have no effect and should be avoided.
M116	Warning	Do not use void expressions	
M117	Warning	Confusing pluses	
M119	Warning	Confusing minuses	
M121	Hint	Declare all function vars on a single line	
M123	Hint	Unnecessary parentheses	
M126	Warning	== and != may perform type coercion, use == = or != = to avoid it	The non - strict equality comparison is allowed to convert its arguments to a common type.That can lead to unexpected results such as ’ \t\r\n’ == 0 being true.Use the strict equality operators == = and != = and be explicit about conversions you require.
M127	Warning	Expression statements should be assignments, calls or delete expressions only	
M128	Error	A state cannot have the specified child item	
M201	Hint	Place var declarations at the start of a function	
M202	Hint	Use only one statement per line	
M203	Warning	Imperative code is not supported in the Qt Quick Designer	
M204	Warning	This QML type is not supported in the Qt Quick Designer	
M205	Warning	Reference to parent QML type cannot be resolved correctly by the Qt Quick Designer	
M206	Warning	This visual property binding cannot be evaluated in the local context and might not show up in Qt Quick Designer as expected	
M207	Warning	Qt Quick Designer only supports states in the root QML type	
M208	Error	This id might be ambiguous and is not supported in the Qt Quick Designer.	
M209	Error	This type(type name) is not supported as a root element by Qt Quick Designer.	
M220	Error	This type(type name) is not supported as a root element of a Qt Quick UI form.	
M221	Error	This type(type name) is not supported in a Qt Quick UI form.	
M222	Error	Functions are not supported in a Qt Quick UI form.	
M223	Error	Java Script blocks are not supported in a Qt Quick UI form.	
M224	Error	Behavior type is not supported in a Qt Quick UI form.	
M225	Error	States are only supported in the root item in a Qt Quick UI form.	
M226	Error	Referencing the parent of the root item is not supported in a Qt Quick UI form.	
M300	Error	Unknown component	
M301	Error	Could not resolve the prototype name of object	
M302	Error	Could not resolve the prototype name	
M303	Error	Prototype cycle, the last non - repeated component is name	
M304	Error	Invalid property type name	
M305	Warning	== and != perform type coercion, use == = or != = to avoid it	See M126.
M306	Warning	Calls of functions that start with an uppercase letter should use new	By convention, functions that start with an uppercase letter are constructor functions that should only be used with new.
M307	Warning	Use new only with functions that start with an uppercase letter
